This module manages local block storage based on `LVM`. The module allows you to create a `StorageClass` in `Kubernetes` by creating [Kubernetes custom resources](./cr.html) `LocalStorageClass` (see example below). 
To create a `Storage Class`, you will need the `LVMVolumeGroup` configured on the cluster nodes. The `LVM` configuration is done by the [sds-node-configurator](../../sds-node-configurator/stable/) module.
> **Caution!** Before enabling the `sds-local-volume` module, you must enable the `sds-node-configurator` module.
>
After you enable the `sds-local-volume` module in the Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform configuration, you have to create StorageClasses.

> **Caution!** The user is not allowed to create a `StorageClass` for the local.csi.storage.deckhouse.io CSI driver.

Two modes are supported: LVM and LVMThin.
Each mode has its advantages and disadvantages. Read [FAQ](./faq.html#what-is-difference-between-lvm-and-lvmthin) to learn more and compare them.

## Quickstart guide

Note that all commands must be run on a machine that has administrator access to the Kubernetes API.

### Enabling modules

- Enable the sds-node-configurator module

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
kind: ModuleConfig
metadata:
  name: sds-node-configurator
spec:
  enabled: true
  version: 1
EOF
```

- Wait for it to become `Ready`. At this stage, you do NOT need to check the pods in the `d8-sds-node-configurator` namespace.

```shell
kubectl get modules sds-node-configurator -w
```

- Enable the `sds-local-volume` module. Refer to the [configuration](./configuration.html) to learn more about module settings. In the example below, the module is launched with the default settings. This will result This will cause the service pads of the `sds-local-volume` components to be launched on all nodes of the cluster.
- This will cause the service pods of the `sds-local-volume` components to be launched on all nodes of the cluster.

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
kind: ModuleConfig
metadata:
  name: sds-local-volume
spec:
  enabled: true
  version: 1
EOF
```

- Wait for the module to become `Ready`.

```shell
kubectl get mc sds-local-volume -w
```

- Make sure that all pods in `d8-sds-local-volume` and `d8-sds-node-configurator` namespaces are `Running` or `Completed` and are running on all nodes where `LVM` resources are intended to be used.

```shell
kubectl -n d8-sds-local-volume get pod -owide -w
kubectl -n d8-sds-node-configurator get pod -o wide -w
```

### Preparing nodes for storage provisioning
To create storage on nodes, it's necessary for the `sds-local-volume-csi-node` pods to be running on the selected nodes.

By default, the pods will be scheduled on all nodes in the cluster. You can verify their presence using the command:

```shell
 kubectl -n d8-sds-local-volume get pod -owide
 ```

> The location of the pod data is determined by special labels (nodeSelector) specified in the `spec.settings.dataNodes.nodeSelector` field in the module settings. For more detailed information on the configuration, please follow the [link](./faq.html#i-dont-want-the-module-to-be-used-on-all-nodes-of-the-cluster-how-can-i-select-the-desired-nodes).

### Configuring storage on nodes

You need to create `LVM` volume groups on the nodes using `LVMVolumeGroup` custom resources. As part of this quickstart guide, we will create a regular `Thick` storage.

> Please ensure that the `sds-local-volume-csi-node` pod is running on the node before creating the `LVMVolumeGroup`. You can do this using the command:

> ```shell
> kubectl -n d8-sds-local-volume get pod -owide
> ```

To configure the storage:

- List all the [BlockDevice](../../sds-node-configurator/stable/cr.html#blockdevice) resources available in your cluster:

```shell
kubectl get bd

NAME                                           NODE       CONSUMABLE   SIZE           PATH
dev-ef4fb06b63d2c05fb6ee83008b55e486aa1161aa   worker-0   false        976762584Ki    /dev/nvme1n1
dev-0cfc0d07f353598e329d34f3821bed992c1ffbcd   worker-0   false        894006140416   /dev/nvme0n1p6
dev-7e4df1ddf2a1b05a79f9481cdf56d29891a9f9d0   worker-1   false        976762584Ki    /dev/nvme1n1
dev-b103062f879a2349a9c5f054e0366594568de68d   worker-1   false        894006140416   /dev/nvme0n1p6
dev-53d904f18b912187ac82de29af06a34d9ae23199   worker-2   false        976762584Ki    /dev/nvme1n1
dev-6c5abbd549100834c6b1668c8f89fb97872ee2b1   worker-2   false        894006140416   /dev/nvme0n1p6
```

- Create an [LVMVolumeGroup](../../sds-node-configurator/stable/cr.html#lvmvolumegroup) resource for `worker-0`:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: storage.deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
kind: LVMVolumeGroup
metadata:
  name: "vg-1-on-worker-0" # The name can be any fully qualified resource name in Kubernetes. This LVMVolumeGroup resource name will be used to create LocalStorageClass in the future
spec:
  type: Local
  local:
    nodeName: "worker-0"
  blockDeviceSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: kubernetes.io/metadata.name
        operator: In
        values:
          - dev-ef4fb06b63d2c05fb6ee83008b55e486aa1161aa
          - dev-0cfc0d07f353598e329d34f3821bed992c1ffbcd
  actualVGNameOnTheNode: "vg-1" # the name of the LVM VG to be created from the above block devices on the node 
EOF
```

- Wait for the created `LVMVolumeGroup` resource to become `Operational`:

```shell
kubectl get lvg vg-1-on-worker-0 -w
```

- The resource becoming `Operational` means that an LVM VG named `vg-1` made up of the `/dev/nvme1n1` and `/dev/nvme0n1p6` block devices has been created on the `worker-0` node.

- Next, create an [LVMVolumeGroup](../../sds-node-configurator/stable/cr.html#lvmvolumegroup) resource for `worker-1`:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: storage.deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
kind: LVMVolumeGroup
metadata:
  name: "vg-1-on-worker-1"
spec:
  type: Local
  local:
    nodeName: "worker-1"
  blockDeviceSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: kubernetes.io/metadata.name
        operator: In
        values:
          - dev-7e4df1ddf2a1b05a79f9481cdf56d29891a9f9d0
          - dev-b103062f879a2349a9c5f054e0366594568de68d
  actualVGNameOnTheNode: "vg-1"
EOF
```

- Wait for the created `LVMVolumeGroup` resource to become `Operational`:

```shell
kubectl get lvg vg-1-on-worker-1 -w
```

- The resource becoming `Operational` means that an LVM VG named `vg-1` made up of the `/dev/nvme1n1` and `/dev/nvme0n1p6` block device has been created on the `worker-1` node.

- Create an [LVMVolumeGroup](../../sds-node-configurator/stable/cr.html#lvmvolumegroup) resource for `worker-2`:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: storage.deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
kind: LVMVolumeGroup
metadata:
  name: "vg-1-on-worker-2"
spec:
  type: Local
  local:
    nodeName: "worker-2"
  blockDeviceSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: kubernetes.io/metadata.name
        operator: In
        values:
          - dev-53d904f18b912187ac82de29af06a34d9ae23199
          - dev-6c5abbd549100834c6b1668c8f89fb97872ee2b1
  actualVGNameOnTheNode: "vg-1"
EOF
```

- Wait for the created `LVMVolumeGroup` resource to become `Operational`:

```shell
kubectl get lvg vg-1-on-worker-2 -w
```

- The resource becoming `Operational` means that an LVM VG named `vg-1` made up of the `/dev/nvme1n1` and `/dev/nvme0n1p6` block device has been created on the `worker-2` node.

- Create a [LocalStorageClass](./cr.html#localstorageclass) resource:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f -<<EOF
apiVersion: storage.deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
kind: LocalStorageClass
metadata:
  name: local-storage-class
spec:
  lvm:
    lvmVolumeGroups:
      - name: vg-1-on-worker-0
      - name: vg-1-on-worker-1
      - name: vg-1-on-worker-2
    type: Thick
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
  volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
EOF
```

- Wait for the created `LocalStorageClass` resource to become `Created`:

```shell
kubectl get lsc local-storage-class -w
```

- Confirm that the corresponding `StorageClass` has been created:

```shell
kubectl get sc local-storage-class
```

- If `StorageClass` with the name `local-storage-class` is shown, then the configuration of the `sds-local-volume` module is complete. Now users can create PVs by specifying `StorageClass` with the name `local-storage-class`.

## System requirements and recommendations

### Requirements
- Stock kernels shipped with the [supported distributions](https://deckhouse.io/documentation/v1/supported_versions.html#linux).
- Do not use another SDS (Software defined storage) to provide disks to our SDS.
